# python-challenge

This is my submission for the Module 3 challenge. Both of the scripts are heavily commented as to explain my thought process.
I also tried a bunch of different ways to rename the txt file in the PyPoll Analysis folder and commit it successfully to the repository, but I could not. Even though it is named alternatively, the code is correct and write everything to the text file.

## DS_Store

I have no what this file is and I tried to remove it but it messed up some of the files within my repository so I'm just leaving it.
